# Introduction
I saw this Medium Google Coding Interview With Ben Awad on Youtube, held by Cl√©ment Mihailescu and wanted to try to solve it myself using Javascript.

# Running
To run this type "node app.js" in the terminal, no input required.

# Requirements
Make sure that node is installed. This was developed with v 14, but newer and older versions should work.

# Problem statement
_A array of arrays, a matrix, that represents an image is the input. 1 represents black pixels. 0 represents white pixels. 
Transform the image so black pixels that are not connected are transformed to white pixels.
A connected black pixel is a pixel that is connected to the edges, or neighbour with another connected pixel. 
The neighbours are in 4 directions: up, down, left and right._

# Example data
